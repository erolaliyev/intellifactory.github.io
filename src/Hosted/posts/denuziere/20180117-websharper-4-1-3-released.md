WebSharper 4.1.3 is now available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/websharper), and as a Visual Studio installer on the [WebSharper website](https://websharper.com/downloads). It is a small bugfix release:

* [#885](https://github.com/dotnet-websharper/websharper/issues/885) Fix regression in Map.remove sometimes returning an empty map.

More exciting stuff is coming soon. Contributors are making good progress on WebSharper 4.2, which will support **.NET Core** and **ASP.NET Core**! The basics are on the rails: WebSharper and WebSharper.UI's libraries are being built for netstandard2.0, and a new WebSharper.AspNetCore package will allow very easy integration with ASP.NET Core. The first pre-alpha should be ready in the coming days.

Happy coding!

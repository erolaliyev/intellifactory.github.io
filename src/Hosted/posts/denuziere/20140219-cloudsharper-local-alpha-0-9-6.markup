Here are the changes for CloudSharper Local alpha 0.9.6:

<ul>
<li>As Adam pre-announced <a href="http://cloudsharper.com/blog/3733/2014217-update-showing-compiler-errors">yesterday</a>, we now have experimental support for MSBuild as an alternative to IntelliFactory.Build. This includes:
<ul>
<li>A new <c>msbuild</c> console command that runs MSBuild. Like <c>build</c>, if you do not pass a build file as argument, it searches for the first compatible build file in the workspace (ie. <c>*.*proj</c> or <c>*.sln</c>).</li>
<li>Intellisense can now read source files and references from <c>*.fsproj</c> files. In particular, this partially fixes <a href="https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/270/project-shows-errors-immediately-after">#270</a>: for projects with no other dependencies than F# and WebSharper, the completion service doesn't report errors anymore on valid projects even before building.</li>
<li>The keyboard shortcut <c>Ctrl+B</c> now triggers <c>msbuild</c> rather than <c>build</c>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/266/deleted-workspace-remains-listed">#266</a>: Unlist deleted workspaces.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/268/keep-focus-in-active-tab-when-sending-code">#268</a>: Keep focus in the active tab when sending code to FSI.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/269/delete-menu-should-not-be-available-at-the">#269</a>: Remove "Delete" context menu option from the workspace root.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/271/deploy-menu-available-prior-to-build">#271</a>: When a Sitelets deployment fails, warn that it might be because the project wasn't built.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/273/view-synchronization-issues">#273</a>: When deleting the current workspace, close it first.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/275/feedback-mechanism">#275</a>: Clear the feedback window after a message has been sent.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/278/appharbour-deployment-config-results-in">#278</a>: When deploying to AppHarbor, warn about the possibility that the browser might be blocking the popup.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/279/intellisense-error-count-not-updating">#279</a>: Remove Intellisense errors related to deleted files.</li>
</ul>

Some future work will focus on the MSBuild support, in particular adding support for simply installing NuGet packages.

Here comes a new release of CloudSharper, with a bunch of bug fixes as well as the first steps of a big UI enhancement.
We are updating CloudSharper to a clearer, slicker and more modern flat visual style.

In this first installment, the startup screen and the dashboard have been completely redesigned, and dialog windows
are also restyled.

## Other improvements
* Autocomplete for F# now filters members. 
* WebSharper has been updated to 3.0.36-alpha, together with the online documentation.

## Fixes
* [#594](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/594/): Autocomplete should not trigger if there is no identifier before `.`
* [#595](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/595/): An exception is raised when creating a new file
* [#596](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/596/): FSI input uses UTF8 encoding now

### Happy coding!

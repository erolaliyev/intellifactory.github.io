When we <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fsharp-opensource/4gS-qoZ2Z1g">announced WebSharper 3.0</a> on Wednesday, we also mentioned that we would be migrating from BitBucket to GitHub. Well, this is now done!

<a href="https://github.com/intellifactory/websharper">Here</a> is the new main repository for WebSharper. All tickets from the BitBucket tracker have also been migrated (apologies to everyone whose mailbox has been spammed by this!), and are available at <a href="https://github.com/intellifactory/websharper/issues">this address</a>. Finally, public extensions have been transferred too (for those that weren't already GitHub-based), and are listed under the <a href="https://github.com/intellifactory?query=websharper">IntelliFactory</a> organization.

We eagerly await your suggestions, bug reports and pull requests on our new repositories!

The demoscene is a computer subculture focused on the creation of demos: short real-time animations showcasing a wide variety of technologies. Among these, web technologies have been getting increasing interest during the last months. DemoJS is an example of this interest: it is a demoparty (a demoscene meeting and competition) that was co-organized by Mozilla Labs in Paris on the 2nd and 3rd of July.

<a href=http://demojs.org/2011/releases/Freestyle/online/Ctrl-Alt-Test_-_Color_The_Wind>Color the Wind</a> is a demo that was developed with WebSharper and presented at DemoJS. It uses the HTML5 Canvas element with a 2D context.

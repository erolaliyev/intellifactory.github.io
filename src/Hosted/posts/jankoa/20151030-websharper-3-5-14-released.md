This is a small bufgix release for SPA projects. Change log:

### WebSharper

* The bundle command (a.k.a Single-Page Application) now extracts non-JS, non-CSS WebResources into `/Content`.
* [#483](https://github.com/intellifactory/websharper/issues/483): Cleaning a bundle project does not fail if output folder does not exists.

Happy coding!

title: "CloudSharper 0.9.20.2 released"
categories: "cloudsharper,f#,websharper"
abstract: "This is a bugfix release for the CS local service."
---
This release fixes a long-standing bug: closing an FSI session by opening or closing a workspace would start an asynchronous infinite loop, spinning CPU and failing to restart FSI properly.

Install the latest local service to avoid this issue.

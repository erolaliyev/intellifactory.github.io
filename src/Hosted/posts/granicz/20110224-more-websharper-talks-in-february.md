It's almost March, but don't rush time - there are still <s>two</s> (**edit - three!**) upcoming [WebSharper](http://www.websharper.com/) talks before the end of February:

 * Feb 25 Kiev Alt.NET - [Anton Tayanovskyy](http://www.intellifactory.com/blogs/anton.tayanovskyy/) (IntelliFactory) and [Vladimir Matveev](http://www.intellifactory.com/blogs/vladimir.matveev/) (IntelliFactory) talk about building WebSharper applications in this session of Kiev Alt.NET dedicated entirely to WebSharper.
 * Feb 26 UWDC 2011 (Russia) - Dmitry Soshnikov talks about [Functional programming in web development](http://uwdc.ru/program/presentation/web-development/funktsionalnoe_programmirovanie_v_veb-razrabotke_izvraschenie_il.html) (in Russian) including using WebSharper.
 * Feb 26 Boise Code Camp (USA) - [Ryan Riley](http://wizardsofsmart.net/) (Logos) talks about [F# on the Web](http://boisecodecamp.com/2011/Sessions/Details/6), discusses his Frack/Frank F# web stack and demostrates how to use WebSharper sitelets and HTML5.

March is also packed with events, including [my WebSharper talk](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/talk-by-adam-granicz) at the [Functional Programming Exchange (FPX) 2011](http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/functionalpx-2011/wd-1207) in London, hosted by SkillsMatter. You may have seen [Don's announcement](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2011/01/19/functional-programming-exchange-2011-london-march-18-2011.aspx) from a while ago - this is indeed going to be one cool event with several awesome sessions on web development with functional languages (F#, Scala, Haskell, etc.). Stay tuned for more WebSharper event announcements!

Functional programming languages have been a hot topic of academic research 
for over 35 years, and are rapidly being adopted in diverse real-world 
settings ranging from from tech startups to financial and biomedical firms. 
A vigorous community of practically-minding functional programmers has come 
into existence, using them as tools to build reliable and fast systems.

CUFP is designed to serve this community.  The aim is for CUFP to be a
place where people can see how others are using functional programming
to solve real world problems; where practitioners meet and
collaborate; where language designers and users can share ideas about
the future of their favorite language; and where one can learn
practical techniques and approaches for putting functional programming
to work.

## Giving a CUFP Talk ##

If you have experience using functional languages in a practical
setting, we invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the
workshop.  We're looking for two kinds of talks:

_Experience reports_ are typically 25 minutes long, and aim
to inform participants about how functional programming plays out in
real-world applications, focusing especially on lessons learned and
insights gained. Experience reports don't need to be highly technical;
reflections on the commercial, management, or software engineering
aspects are, if anything, more important. You do not need to submit a
paper!

_Technical talks_ are expected to be 30-45 minutes long, and should
focus on teaching the audience something about a technical technique
or methodology, from the point of view of someone who has seen it play
out in practice.  These talks could cover anything from techniques for
building functional concurrent applications, to managing dynamic
reconfigurations, to design recipes for using types effectively in
large-scale applications.  While these talks will often be based on a
particular language, they should be accessible to a broad range of
functional programmers.

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to do
so, send an e-mail to francesco(at)erlang-consulting(dot)com or
yminsky(at)janestreet(dot)com by 23 May 2010 with a short description
of what you'd like to talk about or what you think your nominee should
give a talk about. Such descriptions should be about one page long and
include a short biography of the speaker.

The outcome of your proposal will be sent to you no later than the 15th 
of June. Note that presenters, like other attendees, need to register for 
the event. Presentations will be video taped and those presenters who want 
their video released will be expected to sign an ACM copyright release form.

## Program Plans ##

CUFP 2010 will last for two days, and will consist of three
components: CUFP Talks, CUFP Tutorials and CUFP BOFs.

CUFP Talks will consist of a series of talks given by practitioners in
the field.  The talks will be split between shorter experience
reports, describing ways in which functional programming has been
used, either successfully or unsuccessfully, in the real world; and
longer technical talks, which will detail techniques and approaches
for applying functional programming in practical settings.

CUFP Tutorials will be made up of in-depth, hands-on sessions for
learning particular technologies and techniques in functional
programming.  These will range from language introductions for
beginners to more advanced and focused sessions on particular language
features, techniques or toolkits.

CUFP BOFs will consist of so-called "birds-of-a-feather" sessions,
which will create spaces for informal conversations on a variety of
topics.  Among other things, this will be a good venue for language
designers and practitioners to exchange ideas about the future of
functional programming.  As is typical with BOFs, topics will be
chosen beforehand based on a public process for gathering proposals,
organized via our website and a mailing list.

There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to
be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange.

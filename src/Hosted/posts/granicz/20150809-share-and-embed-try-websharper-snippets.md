Just [four days ago](http://websharper.com/blog-entry/4424/introducing-try-websharper) we released [Try WebSharper](http://try.websharper.com), and here we go with the first feature enhancement: embedding snippets. A huge thanks to [Don Syme](https://twitter.com/dsyme) for [suggesting it](https://twitter.com/dsyme/status/628624300661149696).

Each snippet and example now has an Embed tab, giving you the links or the HTML code for embedding it:

For instance, the snooker example you can [play here directly](http://try.websharper.com/cache-example/snooker).

You can also view it as an [embedded content here](http://try.websharper.com/embed-example/snooker), giving you the original source code.

With more features coming soon, we hope you enjoy experimenting and sharing your best F# web programming snippets.

Happy sharing!

Workshop for Commercial Users of Functional Programming 2013
Sponsored by SIGPLAN CUFP 2013
Co-located with ICFP 2013
Boston, MA, United States
Sep 22-24

Talk Proposal Submission Deadline: 29 June 2013

The annual CUFP workshop is a place where people can see how others are using
functional programming to solve real world problems; where practitioners meet
and collaborate; where language designers and users can share ideas about the
future of their favorite language; and where one can learn practical
techniques and approaches for putting functional programming to work.

Giving a CUFP Talk

If you have experience using functional languages in a practical setting, we
invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the workshop. We are
looking for both experience reports and in-depth technical talks.

Experience reports are typically 25 minutes long (but negotiable), and aim to
inform participants about how functional programming plays out in real-world
applications, focusing especially on lessons learned and insights gained.
Experience reports don't need to be highly technical; reflections on the
commercial, management, or software engineering aspects are, if anything, more
important.

Technical talks are also 25 minutes long (also negotiable), and should focus
on teaching the audience something about a particular technique or methodology,
from the point of view of someone who has seen it play out in practice. These
talks could cover anything from techniques for building functional concurrent
applications, to managing dynamic reconfigurations, to design recipes for
using types effectively in large-scale applications. While these talks will
often be based on a particular language, they should be accessible to a broad
range of programmers.

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to do so, send
an e-mail to marius(at)twitter(dot)com or sperber(at)deinprogramm(dot)de or by
29 June 2013 with a short description of what you'd like to talk about or what
you think your nominee should give a talk about. Such descriptions should be
about one page long.

There will be a short scribes report of the presentations and discussions but
not of the details of individual talks, as the meeting is intended to be more
a discussion forum than a technical interchange. You do not need to submit a
paper, just a proposal for your talk! Note that we will need all presenters to
register for the CUFP workshop and travel to Boston at their own expense.

To match yesterdays's official [WebSharper 3 release](http://websharper.com/blog-entry/4323), we are following up with a [CloudSharper](http://cloudsharper.com) update, version 0.9.30.  Most importantly, this release comes with **updated WebSharper 3 project templates** and the new **UI.Next project template** to make it easy to try out WebSharper 3 online.

Other changes and enhancements in this release are:

 * [#601](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/601/pick-autocompletion-on-more-key-presses): Trigger auto completion on more key presses
 * [#604](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/604/add-command-for-opening-a-file-in-document): Add command for opening a file in Document/Split view
 * [#602](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/602/load-blog-entries-with-ajax-for-faster): Load blog entries with ajax for faster display of dashboard
 * [#609](https://bitbucket.org/IntelliFactory/cloudsharper/issue/609/interactive-websharper-compilation-fails): Interactive WebSharper compilation fails to reference assembly that is referenced but not loaded
 
Next, we will be adding various WebSharper 3 **sample applications** (highlighting WinJS, PhoneJS, TODOMvc, and various other more complex applications) on the CloudSharper website, along with a **comprehensive site update** as part of our efforts to ramp up to the upcoming 1.0 release, so keep an eye on the site and on this blog.

Happy coding!

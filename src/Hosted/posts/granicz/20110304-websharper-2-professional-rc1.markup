The first release candidate for <a href="http://www.websharper.com/">WebSharper 2 Professional</a> is out today, with a few bug fixes and better support for 64-bit machines. We are gradually ramping up to the final product release by the end of March, and you can expect a better and more detailed documentation, more tutorials, and the first set of screencasts shortly. RC1 also ships an improved WebSharper Manager that can now identify product updates for both the main platform and any extensions, and provide a download URL to the latest binaries.

As in Beta 5, WebSharper Manager can help you manage your WebSharper product licenses - from getting a trial license for various extensions to upgrading your trial to a full developer license, all with a single click. Furthermore, you can also extend your developer licenses by choosing the Renew option in WebSharper Manager. Any time left on your previous license is tagged onto your new license so you don't lose any development privileges or support coverage (in case of a support license).

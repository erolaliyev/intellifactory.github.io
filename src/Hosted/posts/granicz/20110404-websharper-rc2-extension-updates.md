Today we released a comprehensive set of updates for all extensions targeting WebSharper 2 RC2. If you are using any WebSharper 2 extensions and WebSharper 2 RC2, we recommend that you update your extensions by installing the updates from the [Extensions](http://www.websharper.com/extensions) page. These updates consume the latest WebSharper core libraries and contain a handful of bug fixes for some of the libraries (see the [WebSharper Bugzilla](https://bugs.intellifactory.com/websharper) for details).

You can quickly check on what updates are available and download them using WSM; simply click on Check for updates link on the left panel:

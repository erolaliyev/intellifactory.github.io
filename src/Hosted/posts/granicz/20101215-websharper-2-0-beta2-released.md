We just released a new WebSharper 2.0 Beta (2.0.63) and a matching WebSharper Manager (2.0.10) - please go to the [WebSharper Download Page](http://www.websharper.com/Downloads.aspx) to grab the new binaries.

This beta release delivers a good number of improvements, most notably to sitelets and various speed and installation issues. We have also revised formlet styling and, among others, the new formlet library comes with a cleaner, more attractive look:

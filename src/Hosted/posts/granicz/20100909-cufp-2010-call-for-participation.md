The CUFP 2010 program has been finalized a while ago, and it's great to see that the keynote and a large commercial application talk is about F#. Below is the program and links to the registration page, please grab your seat as soon as you can - it sure will be a great workshop and an excellent opportunity to share your experience with F#.

Functional programming languages have been a hot topic of academic
research for over 35 years, and have seen an ever larger practical
impact in settings ranging from tech startups to financial firms to
biomedical research labs. At the same time, a vigorous community of
practically-minding functional programmers has come into existence.

CUFP is designed to serve this community. The annual CUFP workshop is
a place where people can see how others are using functional
programming to solve real world problems; where practitioners meet and
collaborate; where language designers and users can share ideas about
the future of their favorite language; and where one can learn
practical techniques and approaches for putting functional programming
to work.

CUFP 2010 will feature three hour Functional Programming tutorials
given by language experts on the first day and Experience and
Technical Talks on day two. Attendees may attend either or both days.

Hi everyone, and thanks for the emails asking about the delay in launching WebSharper 2010 Standard. A few days ago an internal release of Visual Studio 2010 RC was made available by Microsoft to various industry partners including ourselves for testing before the public release. As it came right at our official launch date we had to make the hard decision to “silently” postpone releasing WebSharper 2010 Standard until we finished thoroughly testing it on the new Visual Studio.

Now that VS 2010 RC is publicly available, we can finally let you know about the delay. There is a long list of enhancements that have gone into the 2010 Standard product line that were not available in our previous trial drops, and we are excited about this new release bringing a truly unbeatable value.

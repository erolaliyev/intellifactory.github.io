The [jQuery Mobile sample](http://websharper.com/samples/JQueryMobile) on the [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) site has been out for quite some time now, but it fails to mention an important detail on how to run it standalone. Indeed, copying it straight into a new WebSharper ASP.NET project produces an empty page (which is not empty, only jQuery Mobile fails to kick in to decorate it into a full application), which can be a discouraging start for anyone looking into using jQuery Mobile for building mobile applications with F# and WebSharper.

What's not shown in that sample is that the sample runner sitelet adds a container `div` and a "dummy" jQuery Mobile page for the dynamic "paging" mechanism to work. So when you copy-and-paste the sample code into a new application, you need to add that same wrapper yourself. In case you are starting from a WebSharper ASP.NET template, you need to modify the ASPX file as follows:
<code lang="html">
...
<body>
     <div>
            <div data-role="page" id="dummy"></div>
            <ws:MyControl ID="MyControl1" runat="server"/>
     </div>
...
```
Hope this helps.

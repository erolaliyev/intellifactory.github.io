Today we are happy to announce the availability of the jQuery UI extension for WebSharper formlets. This brings a number of new formlet primitives to the standard WebSharper formlet library that are rendered using [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) controls. These include tabs, sliders, drag and drop panels, orderable lists, among others.

<quote>jQuery UI provides abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets, built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library, that you can use to build highly interactive web applications.</quote>

To see how easily you can combine jQuery UI-based formlets to create impressive UIs, check out the new [Formlets for jQuery UI](http://www.websharper.com/samples/JQueryUIFormlet) demo - and see what 100 lines of F# code can give you. As usual, you can grab the extension installer from the [WebSharper extensions](http://www.websharper.com/extensions) page, or download directly from WebSharper Manager:

This brings the number of available WebSharper extensions to 13, those in green being freely available with your WebSharper developer license. Enjoy!

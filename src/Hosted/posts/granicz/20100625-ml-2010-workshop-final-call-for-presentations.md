There is still time to submit your F# talk/presentation/report/demo proposal to [ML 2010](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/ml2010/), co-located with ICFP in Baltimore, MD, USA! I would like to confirm that your submission is still welcome even after the deadline (June 25) - just let us know that you intend to submit and we will make sure that your proposal gets full attention.

Although contributions can be full research papers, ML 2010 also welcomes work-in-progress, status or experience reports, project demonstrations and/or surveys.

This year's workshop marks an important milestone for F#, and your contribution will help to spread the word about successes with F#. You can also meet other F# professionals, collaborators, researchers at the workshop - and the other satellite events associated with ICFP.

Among others, you can meet Luke Hoban from the F# team who is this year's invited speaker, and you can hear first hand about his team's experiences with bringing F# to Visual Studio. This is an absolute must see, so don't miss this opportunity to participate, and submit your own F# content for the community to learn from!

You can find the submission guidelines [here](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/ml2010/cfc.txt) - and if you need help with your proposal I am always happy to help, just drop me a line at `granicz.adam` at `intellifactory.com` with your ideas.

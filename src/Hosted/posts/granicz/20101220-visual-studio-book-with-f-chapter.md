I am proud to announce the availability of the third F# book that I coauthored, [Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4 Six-in-One](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Studio-2010-NET-Programmer/dp/0470499486/) by Wrox:

The book covers a great deal about .NET 4 and Visual Studio 2010, and has a ~75 page F# chapter at the end for your reading pleasure (this is the part I wrote). As with any book, there may be errors and omissions, if you find any we kindly ask you to send your errata to Wrox.

I took a slightly different approach in writing this F# material, and I recommend reading the F# chapter in a single read instead of cherry-picking sections. It's not a reference book by any means, but rather a gentle introduction to F#, quickly covering the basics and concentrating more on a few more advanced topics that "are a must to include in such a short but concise treatment of F#."

I hope you will find the book and the F# chapter in particular useful in your work. Happy reading!

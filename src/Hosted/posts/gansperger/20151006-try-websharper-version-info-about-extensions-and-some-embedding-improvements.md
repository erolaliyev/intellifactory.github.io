Try WebSharper has been updated with some minor improvements regarding version info and embedding snippets.

1. There is now an *About* button which shows a dialog with all the relevant version info of the extensions and a version number for Try WebSharper itself. We are going to do our best to keep all the extensions up-to-date.

2. It is now possible to point at a given tab of an embedded snippet instead of showing the *Result* one by default. You can do it by specifying the tab in the URL by a hash:

  * `#f-sharp`: F# editor
  * `#html`: HTML editor
  * `#result`: Result tab
    
Happy coding!
